# module-week6

For this module we were tasked with creating a weather browser that displays weather forcast.

I have struggled with trying to implement the proper API keys as well as adjusting the display to only display a weeks worth of weather. Instead it displays the equivilent of a months worth.

Also the only way that I can change the location that the weather is pulled from is through the JS file and not on the actual browser page.
